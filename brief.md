**Project Brief for the Development Team**

**Objective:**  
Develop a new website interface that reflects a refreshed visual identity, ensures a highly intuitive user experience, and maintains a strong emphasis on clarity, credibility, and ease of interaction.

---

**Key Design Elements to Implement:**

1. **Color Palette**

    - **Primary Blue (#25334D):**  
      Use as the dominant background color for main sections such as the header, footer, and key highlight areas.
    - **Accent Teal (#21BFAE):**  
      Apply to primary calls-to-action (buttons, critical links) and interactive elements to guide user attention effectively.
    - **Secondary Blue (#597AA3):**  
      Utilize for subtitles, secondary buttons, hover states, and additional graphic elements.
    - **Background Light (#F8FAFD):**  
      Serve as a base for content sections to ensure readability and visual contrast.
    - **Neutral Dark (#2E2E2E) & Grey Mid (#CCCCCC):**  
      Use for text, borders, and subtle separators. The primary text should be Neutral Dark for optimal legibility.

    **Accessibility Note:**  
    Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards. For instance, text over Primary Blue or Accent Teal backgrounds should be white or a sufficiently contrasting hue.

2. **Typography**

    - **Font Family:** A clean, modern sans-serif typeface (e.g., "Poppins" or "Inter").
    - **Headings (H1, H2, H3…):**  
      Use semi-bold to bold weights. Headings should be clearly distinguished from body text, often employing a larger size and possibly a bold weight. Text color generally Neutral Dark (#2E2E2E) or white (#FFFFFF) on darker backgrounds.
    - **Body Text:**  
      Regular weight, 16–18px for desktop. High legibility is critical. Neutral Dark (#2E2E2E) on light backgrounds.

3. **Layout & Grid System**

    - Implement a responsive 12-column grid.
    - Generous whitespace is essential to maintain a clean, uncluttered look and ensure an optimal reading experience.
    - Content blocks should be well-defined with consistent padding and margins.

4. **User Interface Components**

    - **Buttons:**
        - **Primary Buttons:** Accent Teal (#21BFAE) background with white text. Hover states should lighten the background or introduce a subtle glow or border.
        - **Secondary Buttons:** Transparent or light background with Primary Blue (#25334D) text and border. Hovering can introduce a slight background fill (e.g., #F8FAFD).
    - **Forms & Inputs:**  
      Use light backgrounds (#F8FAFD) with clear borders (#CCCCCC) and text (#2E2E2E). Focus states should be clearly indicated (e.g., a subtle border color shift to Accent Teal).
    - **Icons & Illustrations:**  
      Clean, linear iconography that uses Primary Blue and Accent Teal sparingly to highlight key functionalities or information.

5. **Visual Elements & Imagery**

    - Imagery should be placed on light backgrounds to ensure clarity.
    - Photos and illustrations should convey innovation, technology, and a forward-thinking approach, but remain friendly and approachable.
    - Maintain a balance: do not overload pages with visuals. Each image should serve a clear purpose.

6. **Navigation & Usability**

    - The header navigation should be fixed, clear, and consistently styled.
    - Use the Primary Blue for the background of the main navigation bar and white text for menu items.
    - Interactive states (hover, active links) should leverage the Accent Teal for immediate visual feedback.
    - Ensure mobile menus and collapsible navigation elements follow the same styling principles and remain intuitive on touch devices.

7. **Performance & Responsiveness**
    - All designs must be optimized for load speed, ensuring that the use of color backgrounds, images, and icons doesn’t slow down the site.
    - The layout should adapt fluidly to various screen sizes, maintaining readability and usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**Deliverables & Implementation Notes:**

-   The design system (color variables, typography scales, spacing units, etc.) should be integrated into the codebase as reusable components.
-   Style sheets should reflect the defined palette and typographic rules consistently across all pages and modules.
-   Any custom components (carousel, tabs, modal windows) should adhere to the new visual identity and maintain consistent spacing and sizing rules.

**Timeline & Communication:**

-   Prioritize developing and testing core templates (e.g., homepage, product/service pages, contact page) before customizing secondary pages.
-   Maintain open channels with the design and UX teams to ensure that any deviation from the specified guidelines is discussed and approved.
